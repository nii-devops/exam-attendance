1. Polling for Changes with a Cron Job
Overview:
Instead of waiting for a webhook, you can set up a scheduled task (using cron) on your Ubuntu server to periodically check for updates and deploy them. This method doesn’t require any inbound connection from GitHub.

How to Do It:

Create a Deployment Script:
Prepare a shell script (e.g., deploy.sh) that navigates to your app’s directory, pulls changes from GitHub, installs any new dependencies, and restarts your application if needed. For example:

### bash

#!/bin/bash
cd /path/to/yourflaskapp || exit
git pull origin main  # or your branch name
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
sudo systemctl restart yourflaskapp.service
Make it executable:

### bash

chmod +x /path/to/deploy.sh
Schedule the Cron Job:
Open your crontab:

bash
Copy
Edit
crontab -e
And add a line like this to run the script every 5 minutes (adjust as needed):

cron
Copy
Edit
*/5 * * * * /path/to/deploy.sh >> /var/log/flask_deploy.log 2>&1
This way, your server checks GitHub regularly for new commits and updates the code accordingly.
